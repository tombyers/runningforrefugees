    <h3>Hi, I'm Matt</h3>
    <p>Hi,  I’m Matt George, founder of Running for Refugees. I have worked for the Organising Committees for the Olympic, Paralympic and Commonwealth Games, and most recently for Sport Relief. I am also studying for a degree in sport, fitness and coaching from the Open University and coach an under-9 football team.
  I have enjoyed running and a wide variety of sports from an early age and have completed several half marathons. I have always been attracted to the challenge of long distance running and have started a comprehensive training programme.</p>

    <h3>The Charity</h3>
    <a href="#" id="refugee-council-logo"></a>
    <p>Asylum seekers and refugees have been in the news regularly over the last year and sadly the crisis doesn’t seem likely to end anytime soon. Having become frustrated with the negative portrayal of asylum seekers and refugees and the lack of compassion that is sometimes shown towards them, I and the project team wanted to do something to help. Together, the project team decided to support and promote the brilliant work the Refugee Council does to support people seeking asylum, assist refugees to find employment and gain stability with their lives. Running for Refugees was born.</p>
