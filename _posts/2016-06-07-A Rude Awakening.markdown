Finally breaking the 20 mile mark has brought with it mixed feelings.
<br><br>
Let’s start with the positives. Both physiologically and psychologically it represents a big milestone. Before I began training, the furthest I had run was a half marathon and I remember seeing that 13 mile distance as psychologically difficult to go past. So to have reached 20 miles gives me confidence that I’m going in the right direction!  
<br><br>
I did however find the run very difficult to complete. So far my training has progressed without each increase in distance feeling too scary or physically unattainable. Sure I have had injuries and struggled with fitting in all my training  but once I have got out and onto the road I have felt able to complete each run. The 20 miler didn’t feel like that! I had to stop to stretch at 15 miles and my legs felt like lead by the time I dragged myself to the end. It has been a rude awakening to the work I have left to do, not only to run 6 miles further but to do that 33 times.  
<br><br>
There are some lessons to be learnt too. It was a pretty hot and muggy day but naively I chose to forgo the water to reduce weight/ inconvenience.  My lips getting stuck together by the 11th mile perhaps indicates that my lack of hydration did play its part in my rapid performance decline towards the end of the run.  
<br><br>
Above all else, my top tip from this 'journey' so far is to remain as positive as possible. After all, I always knew that this experience was going to be a challenge; it would be disappointing if it wasn't!
