Today is going to be a shorter one than usual. I have done back to back 30-milers and today also included a speaker’s appearance in Leominster. So needless to say I am pretty wiped! 
<br><br>
I would however like to say a few thank yous. First of all to Susanna and Mandy for patiently waiting for me on Wye Bridge in Hereford in order to cheer me on as I went past. I did get a chance to stop and speak to them for a few minutes and it turns out that Susanna had walked John O’Groats to Land’s End about 11 years ago. It was great to hear a little bit about her experience. They also very kindly gave me a donation. 
<br><br>
The second thank you goes to Guy Whitmarsh who joined me for the last 6 miles of today’s run despite the torrential rain. Guy is not only a keen fell runner but he is also a member of the local Amnesty group and has an adopted daughter who is a refugee. He said that when we saw an email with the details of my challenge it ticked lots of boxes for him! It was fantastic to have a running partner and it really kept me going for the last few miles into Ludlow. Guy has also put lots of time behind organising a send-off for me tomorrow morning. I am sure I will go into more detail about that in tomorrow’s blog. 
<br><br>
The final thank you is to Trish Marsh and all at Leominster Churches Together who very kindly asked me to speak the their meeting tonight. They all showed such enthusiasm for the run and were very kind in their donations too. A special mention to the other speaker of the evening, David Bland, who is heading up a small charity that is helping in the refugee camps in Calais. His insights were very thought provoking and gave me a much better idea of what life looks like for the refugees that are in those camps. 
<br><br>
Tomorrow is number 11 – let’s hope that I wake up in time. Thanks everyone  - Matt.
