The catch phrase for the run has quickly become ‘well it is supposed to be a challenge’! Today, as you have already guessed, certainly lived up to that. 
<br><br>
I should begin by introducing my new travelling companion, Anna. The story of how I met Anna epitomises the generosity of strangers that has become a defining part of this challenge. When we were filling the slots of who was going to drive the support car, for one reason or another, we just couldn’t find anyone who was available for the stretch from Bristol to Whitchurch (near Crewe). I turned to a website that I had used before called ‘Impossible’ and without much optimism put out an ad for a support driver. Anna got back to me within hours. It turned out that she was passionate about the cause, was used to driving other people cars and wasn’t fazed by spending five days in very close quarters with me. So when Anna arrived in Bristol on Saturday evening, it was the first time that we had met. Since then we have both had to work quickly to establish a level of trust and understanding that is so important for what is quite an intense working relationship. I think we’ve done a good job of that so far. 
<br><br>
Back to today. With our new partnership already starting to gel, we headed for the start line near Bristol Airport. It was a gorgeous day and I thoroughly enjoyed winding my way down into Bristol, along the banks of the River Avon and then under the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The middle third of the run wasn’t quite as picturesque (unless industrial estates are your thing) but I was soon running across the Severn Bridge which offers spectacular views along the River Severn. 
<br><br>
You might be thinking that the day I have described so far is no more challenging than any of the previous seven marathons that I have run. You might even be tempted to accuse me of falsely preluding this blog with two sentences that suggested an out of the ordinary day. Well up until the end of the Severn Bridge everything had been fairly ordinary. However as I ran towards the end of the bridge Anna came into sight. At first I thought she was simply coming to say hello and admire the view from the bridge but as I went past she said something about Tallulah and then something about loss of gears. 
<br><br>
The gears had gone when Anna was driving across the Severn Bridge and she did very well to freewheel Tallulah off the bridge and onto the hard shoulder. What followed was a long wait for the roadside recovery, the verdict that the clutch was the issue and a tow back to a garage in Bristol. 
<br><br>
Without a support car it is actually very difficult to complete the challenge in the way that we have designed it. So as you can imagine there was a certain sense of measured panic. But I needn’t have worried. I am incredibly lucky to have a very fast working support network and miraculously we have a replacement car organised which is due to be delivered to Bristol tomorrow morning. It is very hard to explain how this all fell into place but I would like to say a particular thank you to James Alexander who is not only providing this replacement car but is also the one driving it to Bristol. 
<br><br>
I do hope that tomorrow isn’t quite as eventful.
