We started today dealing with a second helping of car trouble. After Tallulah bit the dust in Bristol, I thought I might be saying goodbye to car number two before I had even reached Scotland. I needn’t have worried; the warning light that had appeared over the last few days was due to a faulty fuse and was both inexpensive and quick to fix. Enough of cars though, let’s get back to the running…
<br><br>
The road from Kendal to Shap peaks at an elevation of 1,394 feet and so, once I did get running, for the first 5 miles I was going up almost constantly. I had however been pre-warned of the climb (thank you very much Dad) and as a result had prepared myself for an uphill slog. I got to the top gasping a little bit but happy in the knowledge that the next section was going to be largely downhill.

From Shap the A6 winds either side of the M6 until it reaches Penrith. During the first part of that stretch, I really found my rhythm and experienced a rare moment of ‘mind calmness’. Of course moments pass and I was soon longing for Penrith to appear around each corner. Eventually it did and I headed for the checkpoint at the far side of the town. From there it was a further five miles along the A6 to our finish point for the day near a village called Plumpton.

Tomorrow is the day I cross over into Scotland and to say that I am excited is an understatement. Until then I am going to sign off this rather short blog by giving you a bit of an insight into what is currently going on in run HQ this evening. Court & Jo, good friends of mine and the current support crew, are busy watching Grease. Naturally they know all the words and so far have been very willing to prove it by singing at the tops of their voices. Rest assured I will be joining in as soon as I have posted this blog!

Good night all.
