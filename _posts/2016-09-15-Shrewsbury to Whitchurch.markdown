After I completed marathon number 7 last Friday, I said in my blog that I wanted to start to talk more about the Refugee Council and the work that they do. After all it is a cause that I am passionate about and one that I think is vitally important. However several times since, I have gone to start writing about the charity’s work and have hesitated and then chosen to go down a different path. 
<br><br>
Well during today’s marathon I spent a good chunk of time thinking about why I was struggling to find the right words. The conclusion I came to was this; the Refugee crisis is a complex and heated topic and people hold strong opinions on the right course of action. Meanwhile I have always been one to err on the side of caution, especially when it comes to speaking my mind about subjects that polarise opinion. In other words I have a tendency to hold back from expressing my views, feelings or beliefs if I think they won’t be well received. Of course by ‘running for refugees’ I am already making a clear statement as to my views about how I think the UK should welcome refugees. But if I were just to run, then my support of the Refugee Council would be rather passive; support by association if you will. Instead I want to actively support and promote the work that the charity does. So brace yourself…
<br><br>
First a bit of background. During 2015 an average of 24 people per minute were forced to flee due to war or persecution (1). This meant that by the end of 2015 65.3 million people were displaced, the highest it has been since records began (1). When we hear these figures it is so easy to forget the people that they represent. There also appears to be a tendency to talk about the refugee crisis as a crisis for European countries and whilst I completely understand that the challenges this crisis has placed on Europe have been immense (and as such deserve attention), the reason I am so passionately supporting the Refugee Council is that they seek to support and empower those at the centre of the crisis; the people that have been forced from their homes and their countries. 
<br><br>
The Refugee Council provide a whole range of services to support and empower Refugees and now that I have started the ball rolling, I will use subsequent blogs to delve into exactly what these services do. I should say at this stage that I will not be delving too far into the numbers of Refugees that the UK accepts. While you can guess my general views on the topic, I do recognise that there are many complexities that surround this issue. What I would say however is that the Refugee Council do undertake advocacy and influencing work which includes doing what they can to influence policy and parliamentarians. You can find out more about this on their [website](http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research).

I do hope that this blog hasn’t been too heavy! I thought it would be nice to finish with a something a little lighter to reward those who have made it to the end of my rambling. So this should make you laugh (or at least force a small internal smile). 
<br><br>
You would have thought that the man who is running 32 marathons in 36 days would know the length of a marathon… Well it turns out that he doesn’t! I was convinced that it was 26.6 miles but part way through marathon 12 something compelled me to double check. It turns out that a marathon is ‘only’ 26.219 miles. As we have planned out the stopping points using my incorrect distance, I will continue to run 26.6 miles (aka ‘the Matt marathon’) each day. All that it proves is that I am working extra hard for your donations!
