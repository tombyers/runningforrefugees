Today, after 492 miles (on average I have run more than a marathon each day), I made it to the Scottish border. Over the last few days it has been this milestone that has been my main driving force; it not only felt like a significant and tangible marker but it crucially felt more immediately attainable than the ultimate end of the challenge. 
<br><br>
Those of you who have been reading these blogs consistently, will know that when I reached Bristol after seven days of marathons, I experienced a period of feeling rather flat. I had prepared myself for a similar feeling today and although it did surface shortly, I still had six miles left of the marathon and so was able to quickly refocus on the next target. It does make me wonder what it could feel like if I manage to reach John O’Groats in a little over two weeks’ time. The chances of experiencing an interesting mix of emotions seems quite high. 
<br><br>
During every marathon that I have run I have thought at one time or another about Refugees and the work of the Refugee Council. It has however been after major milestones that these thoughts have intensified. As I write about the likelihood of me experiencing mixed emotions at the end of my journey, I cannot even imagine the mix of emotions that a refugee may experience when starting a life in a new country. 
<br><br>
A while ago I read a book called the Lightless Sky by Gulwali Passarlay. Gulwali fled Afghanistan at the age of 12 and the book is a harrowing account of his journey across Europe. A part of his story comes to mind when writing about the psychological challenge of ending one journey before having a sense of what the next journey even is. Gulwali had reached Italy and had ended up in a centre that was, in many ways, the place of safety that he had been looking for. But instead of feeling safe, he felt increasingly more trapped and isolated. In the end we escaped. When I think about it, this response is completely understandable. Gulwali had been forced out of his home country and risked his life to get to Europe. During his journey he was at the mercy of traffickers, having very little choice as to what happened to him next. When he finally reached some sort of safety he found that it felt intensely uncomfortable and crucially the element of choice was still missing. 
<br><br>
This part of Gulwali’s story, and the book as a whole, helped me to gain some level of contextual understanding of what refugees experience. It also helped me to orientate the importance of the work that the Refugee Council undertakes. Programmes such as the Children’s Section (that I talked about in [this blog]( http://www.runningforrefugees.co.uk/2016/09/16/Whitchurch-to-Warrington.html)) do start to give choice back to young refugees. The Therapeutic Services that the charity offers are also crucially important as they offer counselling and psychological support. I am going to be focusing more on this part of the Refugee Council’s work in an upcoming blog. 
<br><br>
That is all for now. Tomorrow I continue with my journey.
