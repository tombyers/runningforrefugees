It feels like quite a lot has happened since I last wrote a blog post. Sunday’s marathon was as challenging as Saturdays, with my left leg continuing to cause me a fair deal of pain. I did however have a big boost with the arrival of my good friend Sean. He brought a fold up bike with him which meant that he could cycle alongside me for most of the day. His company was especially valuable as my pace slowed and the pain in my leg increased. By the time I reached the second checkpoint in Inverness I was really starting to struggle and the last 6 miles were almost a crawl. 
<br><br>
I managed to drag myself across the line and we drove the short distance to where we were staying. A lump had appeared on my shin and my ankle had swollen considerably. I was finding it difficult to walk. For the first time since starting this challenge, I had real doubts as to whether I could make it to the end. To have run 27 marathons and be forced to stop just 5 from the end was a fairly devastating thought.
<br><br>
The rest day had come at exactly the right point and offered an opportunity to do all I could to get my body into a good enough shape to attempt the last five days. With help from my physio Jess and our hosts Bettie and Brian, we made a plan for the rest day. It involved visiting a minor injury unit in Dingwall to confirm our suspicions of the presence of shin splints and then a whole routine of ice, foam rolling, elevation, compression, drugs, creams etc etc. I have to say that Will, Sean, Bettie and Brian were absolutely fantastic at looking after me. With their help I was able to get back to some kind of working order. I was able to start thinking about the final stretch again. 
<br><br>
I should mention at this stage that my rest day also included a trip to The Highlands Support Refugees Group. I am going to talk more about our visit in tomorrow’s blog but I will say at this stage that our time there was a further boost for me going into the final stint. 
<br><br>
Somehow this morning I found myself back at the start of another marathon. I knew that it was going to be another tough day with my leg patched up rather than fully healed. But with Sean back by my side I made steady progress, crossing the Cromarty Bridge at around the 10 mile mark. At the checkpoint in Evanton I had the rather unusual experience of shaving my lower leg in a public car park. It was in an attempt to give more purchase to the sport tape that I was using and therefore provide more support to my leg. 
<br><br>
By the time I reached the second checkpoint in Lamington I had completed just under the marathon distance but was still several miles short of our end point in Tain (we had to add on distance to avoid the A9). My leg still felt OK and so I decided to carry on. Unfortunately it was on the final stretch that my leg gave up on me. As I reached the support car on the outskirts of Tain, I was in considerable pain and was helped into the car by Will. 
<br><br>
I am pleased to say that as I type this the recovery seems to have gone quite well. I will certainly be back on the start line tomorrow morning and will summon all the energy I have left to plod my way through the next 4 days.
