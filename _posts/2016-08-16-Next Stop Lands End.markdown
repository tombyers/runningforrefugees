Hello everybody. Welcome to my final blog before I get underway on Saturday. I recall saying in a recent post that my excitement was outweighing my nerves. I have to be honest and say that the tables have definitely turned. I can be a worrier at the best of times but with lots to get done in the next few days and then the prospect of a long series of marathons, I am more on edge than normal!

The good thing at this stage of any busy patch is that deadlines mean things have to get done. I have to finish my job tomorrow, I have to leave for Land’s End on Friday and I have to start running on Saturday morning. Therefore despite my nerves, I am looking forward to being on the start line. The time of just talking about the run has almost run out.

Some people have asked me how they can keep up with the challenge. I’m delighted to say that there’ll be lots going on. As well as these blogs continuing every few days, I will be posting updates to Facebook and Twitter (you can find the links at the bottom of the page) and will even be giving Facebook Live a go. All being well there will also be a live tracker on the home page of this site so you can see my physical location along the route. With all that activity it will be a miracle if you’re not sick of me by the end of five weeks!

Thanks so much for reading. Bring on the run!
