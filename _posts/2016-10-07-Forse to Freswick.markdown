So here we are; the eve of the final day. I feel a certain responsibility to make this blog a good one! 
<br><br>
Let’s start with a quick note on today’s marathon. It was, as I explained last night, the final full marathon of this challenge and so it did feel a bit different. My legs seemed to appreciate the special occasion and really stepped up to the challenge. It was the fastest pace that I have managed since I picked up the injury last week. 
<br><br>
The first 14 miles took me from the small settlement of Forse into the urban metropolis that is Wick. Wick isn’t of course anything like an urban metropolis but the last two days have consisted of a series of small villages separated by lots of open road and so in contrast Wick felt rather large. After a quick pit stop I picked my way through Wick and as I was leaving glanced up at one of those road signs that lists how far away other towns are. There was John O’Groats just 16 miles away. The proximity was a bit of a shock.
<br><br>
The final 10 miles were an odd mix. A part of me was looking forward to the finish line, grateful that I was soon to have a prolonged break from the 26.2 mile distance. But the other part of me was sad to see the miles tick down. They have provided a rigid structure for me over the last five weeks so much so that my days have revolved around a series of set milestones. I would start with getting to 6 miles then climb up to 10. From there it would be the short hop to 13; the halfway point. 16.2 marked 10 miles to go and wasn’t too far away from the big 2 0. At 24 miles I could start the ‘almost 2 miles to go countdown’ and by 26 I knew that it was all but over. 
<br><br>
Of course reaching the marathon distance today means that this entire challenge is all but over. Tomorrow I have just 5 miles to complete to reach John O’Groats. Even typing that sentence feels unreal!
<br><br>
Making it to the final night does lead me to reflect on what has been a roller-coaster 5 weeks. Aside from remembering lots of running, what stands out for me is the generosity of others. It has been my feet doing the running but it has been the hands of so many others that have sculpted this challenge into what it has become. With that in mind I am going to be using this blog and tomorrow’s blog to thank the people that have made this possible. 
<br><br>
Let’s start with the hosts. Whilst planning the run we discussed several different solutions as to where we were going to stay. We talked about hotel and campervan sponsors and even talked about braving a tent. In the end we thought the most likely outcome was that we would stay with people we knew where possible and pay for accommodation where it wasn’t. Unbelievably we have been hosted every single night on our way up the country. That works out as 27 different hosts for the 36 days of travel. The kindness that these people have shown to us has genuinely blown me away and I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to them all. I have tried to mention them all individually in these blogs but do have a few people left to thank. So thank you to Teen and Stuart for hosting us on Tuesday night. I thoroughly enjoyed the lasagne and bacon sandwiches and also hope that Abbie got on OK at the vets. Next to thank is Malachy for kindly offering us your self-catering cottage in Brora. The views there were simply stunning. Thank you also to Cousin Richard for organising that for us. And finally I would like to thank our host for the last two nights – Catherine. Catherine lives on a farm near a small village called Halkirk and both days she has welcomed me with a bag of frozen peas for my leg! She has also gone out of her way to cook us delicious meals with tonight’s veggie sausage casserole being particularly good. 
<br><br>
Next up is to say thank you to those who have come out to join me on the road. I have mentioned these people in previous blogs but I really want to reiterate the difference that their presence made. I was honoured to be joined by Guy Whitmarsh on my approach into Ludlow. The next day a group of Ludlow Runners accompanied me on my way out. Then there was Andy Warnock who braved extremely high winds to cycle alongside me in Lanarkshire. I then had the pleasure of Kevin Murray’s presence – he joined me for multiple stints in the Aberfeldy area. Finally I was joined by Sean Holmes. One of my closest friends, Sean’s company was invaluable at a time when I was really struggling with injury. 
<br><br>
I hope that I am managing to convey just how many people have been involved in this challenge and just how brilliant they have all been. I do have some more individuals to thank but am conscious that I have been going on for far too long already. 
<br><br>
So let’s reconvene tomorrow. By then I will be an End-to-Ender!
