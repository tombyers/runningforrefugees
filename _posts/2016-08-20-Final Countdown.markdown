It’s been a while since my last blog and suddenly I find myself just over two weeks away from starting this mammoth challenge. Before looking ahead though I’d like to recap what’s happened since I last wrote.
<br><br>
First of all the pub quiz! On 3rd August we packed 90ish people into an upstairs room in The Rose pub Vauxhall. There literally wasn’t a chair left spare and so I found myself perching on a radiator at the front of the room! For three hours the teams were treated to a brilliant quiz that had had been lovingly created by Jess and Sian, two of friends from my time at Comic Relief. Thank you to everyone that attended and especially to quiz masters Jess and Sian; we raised a fantastic £700. 
<br><br>
A few days later it was time for fundraising event number two. But rather than being in another part of London or the UK, this fundraiser took place in Melbourne, Australia. My good friends Jo and Liv organised a film screening at a Melbourne cinema and raised $300. I have even heard that the film wasn’t great (one viewer jokingly asked for a refund). Nonetheless I really appreciate the support of the cause from the other side of the world. 
<br><br>
I have said this before and will undoubtedly say it again but the kindness of others has been the best part of this journey so far. Whether they’re good friends or relative strangers, people have been so generous with their words, their time and indeed with their money. Thank you to you all. 
<br><br>
So now to dare to look forward. There are 14 sleeps until I take my first steps at Land's End on 3rd September. In that time I will finish my job, move out of London and attempt to get as much of my university work done as possible. 
<br><br>
With all that in mind, I am understandably fairly nervous. However the dominant feeling is excitement; I really can’t wait to get started. I look forward to having you along for the journey.
