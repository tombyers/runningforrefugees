Today was the start of week three of marathons and there are some big milestones coming up. 
<br><br>
First of all tomorrow (Tuesday) sees me run marathon 16. The attentive among you will know that 16 is the magic halfway point. On one hand making it to half way is a big boost; I now know what 16 marathons feels like and I know that I can run them. But it is for the same reasons that the milestone also feels very difficult; although I know that I can run 16 marathons, I know what they feel like and they don’t always feel particularly great! 
<br><br>
The next milestone this week is reaching Scotland on Thursday. I am of course very aware of the size of Scotland and so I am under no illusion that reaching Scotland is almost the end. However having England and Wales behind me does start to signal the beginning of the end and so will give me a boost nonetheless. 
<br><br>
The final milestone is on Sunday when I reach Glasgow; a city that I know well from my time working on the Commonwealth Games back in 2013/2014. Glasgow is a fantastic city and I have a good group of friends there and so I am excited to be back. 
<br><br>
Despite these milestones, I do need to take one day at a time. Getting too far ahead of myself won’t help with the daily task of completing 26.2 miles. Today was one of those days that I just put my head down and powered through. It didn’t feel particularly comfortable but at the same time there were no major problems either.  
<br><br>
I’d like to finish by doing some further thankyous. Firstly to the entire Walsh family. Killian has been my support driver over the last three marathons and has been absolutely brilliant. He is very laid back which has helped me to loosen up a bit! Joey Walsh has put us up for the last two nights and has been kind enough to sleep on the sofa to give me a bed to sleep in. I also met Killian and Joey’s parents and grandparents during my rest day and they were all very supportive of the run. A special thankyou goes to Grandma Ireland who donated £10 to the cause. Finally I would like to mention my mum’s cousin David and his wife Alyson. A few days back they tracked me down whilst I was running, pulled over and both gave me big hugs of support. 
<br><br>
That is all for now. Please do forgive me if this blog has not made a great deal of sense, I have tried my best to battle through a wall of tiredness tonight. Sleep well!
