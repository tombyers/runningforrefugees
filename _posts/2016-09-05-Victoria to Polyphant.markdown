Day three was always set to be the biggest challenge so far and it proved to be just that. We had been told that there was a long section of roadworks along the A30 which formed a major part of the route for today’s marathon. So this morning started with four of us closely examining a series of maps, trying to find the best alternatives for me to use. Our conclusion was that I would start the run as planned but that after the first 9 miles (which took place on slightly less busy roads) I would divert away from the planned route along the A30 and instead climb into the Cornish hills. We thought that this would end up adding 2-3 miles onto the day. 
<br><br>
All went to plan for a while. The first 9 miles went by without any issues and the journey up into the twisty turning lanes was actually really fun. It reminded me of camping holidays when I was kid – we often used to spend a week or two each summer tucked away in a remote part of Cornwall or Devon. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately events after that didn’t really go to plan. Coming towards the end of our diversion we found that the road had been closed. More frustratingly we could see where I needed to be just 100 metres away but I couldn’t quite get there; the now dreaded A30 was standing stubbornly in our path with the road works meaning that an otherwise simple crossing was now not possible. 
<br><br>
My brother Chris and I stood for a while in the boggy field discussing our options. We had ruled out an attempt to navigate through the roadworks by climbing over fences. We then talked about whether I should run back the way we had come. In the end we settled on a compromise. Chris would drive me round to the road that I needed to be on; the road that we could see just over the other side of the A30. Unfortunately driving there took a long time as we had to wiggle back through the country lanes but we made it in the end and I coaxed my body back into action after it had seized up in the car. 
<br><br>
The next challenge was running along the A30. I have completed sections of the road on both days one and two but this section was busier and was not so pleasant to run down. I did however make good time and was glad to complete the final two miles on quiet country lanes. 
<br><br>
I am pleased to say that tomorrow’s route looks much nicer.

That’s all for now – onto marathon number 4.
