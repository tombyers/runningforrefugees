The half way point has arrived! The sun came out to celebrate the occasion and the route, which took me from Lancaster to north of Kendal, took in some beautiful views across the Lancashire/Cumbria countryside. 
<br><br>
We set off early from our accommodation in Fleetwood and were in Lancaster by 08:30. After I had faffed around for a bit (you would have thought that I would have got into a minute by minute routine by now) I plodded north and was soon leaving Lancaster behind. The first part of the run was alongside the A6 as it winds through towns such as Bolton-le-Sands and Carnforth but it wasn’t until I turned off the A6 at Beetham that things started to get a bit more interesting. 
<br><br>
It is sometimes hard to know from a map exactly what type of road is going to greet you. I find that this adds a bit of excitement to proceedings (I am easily pleased). The road that I took off of the A6 was called Paradise Lane, a name that I think describes it well. It was a single track road nestled in between hedgerows with a grass strip that ran along it’s centre. Every now and then the hedgerows were interrupted by a gate or fence and in those moments the views over the hills were beautiful. Paradise Lane ran down into Ackenthwaite and not long after I was running alongside the East Coast mainline railway. I have always loved trains I will admit that when the Virgin trains snaked past I did let out an audible ‘oooohhh’. 
<br><br>
Leaving the railway line behind me, I trotted into Kendal for the final checkpoint of the day. I was already feeling achy by this stage so I suspected that the last 7 miles were going to be a bit of a slog. I was also a little apprehensive about whether the road might be very busy. It turns out that ½ of my predictions were correct. The road wasn’t especially busy and there was plenty of room for cars to get round me. It was however a bit of a slog! The road gradually rose and then rose again. My legs weren’t overly impressed by this but my head knew that there wasn’t far to go. 
<br><br>
It probably won’t surprise you that there is a part of me that is a sucker for punishment. It is that part of me that weirdly enjoys the moments in which my legs feel hollow and I am not quite sure how much further they will carry me before they start to buckle. Fortunately in this case they stayed strong until the end. 
<br><br>
Tonight we are staying in a small village called Natland which is just south of Kendal. I do want to say a big thank you to our hosts for the evening, Angela and Andrew. They very kindly agreed to put us up at the last minute after we realised that I had made an error with the location of our original hosts (I had put them down for tonight’s slot but they actually live in Cheshire - thank you Mike and Gill for offering to have us to stay and sorry that we have already passed you!).

Thanks for reading everyone and have a great evening.
