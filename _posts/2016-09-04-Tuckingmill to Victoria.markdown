This morning started with a push start. No I haven’t yet got to the stage of needing to be pushed at the start of my runs. The push start was for Tallulah (my car) after we accidently left the lights on for a little while last night. Fortunately she was parked on a hill so it wasn’t long before she was back in action. 
<br><br>
We made our way back to Tuckingmill and I got underway at 09:30. My main task of the day was to be wary of my pace. I have to think long term and not tire myself out or tempt any injuries. On the whole I was fairly successful although there is still room for improvement. 
<br><br>
The first section of toady was through Tuckingmill and into Redruth, all of which was completed on the luxury of pavements. Soon the pavements were left behind and I was back to running along the side of the road. Before I started this challenge, it was the road running that provided one of the main concerns but it is something that I have got used to very quickly. And so as I approached the A30 (the first major road that I have had to run down) I was confident that I would be able to adapt. And I am happy to say that it really wasn’t too bad. Yes there was a lot of traffic travelling at 60-70 mph but the size of the road meant that there was plenty of space along the side. 
<br><br>
After 6-7 miles on the A30 I turned off, wriggled under a gate and made my way along a track that ran parallel with the main road. I climbed over the barbed wire at the far end of the track and ran on through several small villages and then along a single lane road lined with fields and cows. It was a lovely contrast to the traffic on the A30. 
<br><br>
The final section of the run took me through Goss Moor National Nature Reserve. And again it was lovely to be off the roads and surrounded by nature. The only downside was navigating a very muddy stretch of track but it added a bit of excitement to the end of the marathon. 
<br><br>
I ended up completing just over 28 miles today, partially due to a slight change to the route and partially due to me missing turns and having to double back on myself. But as I type this my legs don’t feel too bad and I’m all ready to get going for marathon number three tomorrow morning.
<br><br>
To conclude this overly long blog, I would like to say a big thank you to our hosts for the last three nights – my uncle, Paul and his wife Sheila. It has been lovely to spend the evenings with them and I am hugely grateful for their interest, enthusiasm and support of the run.
