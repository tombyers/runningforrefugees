Today was possibly the toughest day of the entire challenge. From the very start, every other step that I took was greeted with a small but noticeable dosage of discomfort on the top of my left foot/ankle. It was a pain that has come up a few times since I started almost a month ago. It first appeared in my left foot back on day four as I hobbled over the line in Okehampton. Then a few days ago, as I finished just north of Dunblane, I was hobbling again but this time with pain in my right foot. In both of those occasions an evening of extra TLC seemed to do the trick and I was back running largely pain free the next day. My major concern with this latest episode is that the pain started right at the beginning of the day and continued throughout. Nonetheless I will be doing all I can to get myself fighting fit for tomorrow. It is after all the last day before I have a rest day and therefore the chance to do some more thorough investigations.

With recovery being more important than ever this evening, this blog will unfortunately be on the short side. I did however want to mention and thank all those that have been sending me messages of support. For the last few weeks I have been living in a bubble and in some ways it feels strange that people are watching my progress from afar. But on tricky days like today, messages of support genuinely make all of the difference.

I am very pleased to be finishing this blog on an extremely positive note. Overnight we made it to our initial £10,000 target! It is a big moment for everyone that has been involved with piecing this challenge together and it really makes all of the hard work worthwhile. Thank you so much to everyone that has donated; the Refugee Council will put your money to fantastic use supporting people who have lost so much in their lives. Fingers crossed that we can reach an even higher figure by the time I get to John O’Groats in a weeks’ time.
