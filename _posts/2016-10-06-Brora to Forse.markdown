*Sorry for the delay posting the blog – having to find internet cafes to access the web! Tomorrow’s blog may also be delayed a little but I will make sure it goes up ASAP*
<br><br><br><br>
Last night we stayed in Brora overlooking the golf course and the sea beyond. If the views were beautiful enough last night, they were absolutely stunning with the rising sun this morning. I have enjoyed the scenery all along my route but today’s views have to be up there with my personal favourites. The sun stayed out and we were treated to gorgeous coast line for almost the entire day. <br><br>
As I have noted in my blogs, I have frequently experienced restlessness whilst completing the runs. I have described this as ‘watch watching’ but it has also manifested itself in simply overthinking things or worrying about anything that could possibly be worried about. This constant internal monologue is nothing new for me but having four hours each day on my own does significantly increase the available time to worry. Today was different. For the longest period of time so far on this challenge I felt calm and content with being in the moment. I enjoyed the views and the sun on my face and didn’t get carried away with how many miles were left. It’s only taken me 30 marathons… 
<br><br>
Perhaps one of the reasons for my mental calmness was that the pain in my ankle/shin was (for the majority of the marathon) much more manageable. To be running without major discomfort was a big boost. Unfortunately around the 22nd mile mark it finally gave up and sent spikes of pain through my lower left leg. It is at these moments that I wonder what passing drivers must think; here is a man going at a snail’s pace in the direction of John O’Groats and he’s got a major hobble on. If I were them I would be doubting whether I could make it. I have however become better at pain management over the last few days. All I really need to do is squirt a good load of water over my shin and into my shoe. The coolness of the water seems to offer enough respite to see me through to the end. 
<br><br>
Tomorrow brings with it the final full marathon of this challenge and will take me within 10 miles of John O’Groats. The end is almost in sight.

Thank you for reading.
