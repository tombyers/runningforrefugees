The challenge of running 33ish marathons in 37 days, I hope you will agree, is suitably challenging. Earlier this week I was talking to a friend about the run when she asked for clarification about exactly what was involved. She had thought that the challenge not only included the marathons but that I was going to attempt it without sleep. ‘5 weeks without sleep!?’ I said, ‘whilst running a marathon each day?’. She replied, ‘well I was a bit worried!’.

In the interests of openness I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that I intend to be sleeping a lot during the challenge. But thank you Gemma for thinking about my well being, it’s genuinely very kind of you. Thank you for making me laugh too!

In other news, I am excited to say that I will be making my first radio appearance next week. Next Tuesday morning I will be speaking about the run on the Star Radios breakfast show in Cambridge. You can listen on the web here.

That’s all lovely people. Thank you for reading!
