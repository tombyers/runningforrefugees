Sorry for posting this a day late - technical difficulties stopped me from posting it last night!
<br><br>
I am going to attempt to keep today’s blog nice and short. Tiredness has really caught up with me today and I still have some exercises to do before I crawl into bed. 
<br><br>
Today’s route was much nicer than yesterday and the weather conditions were also kind. I covered the first 11 miles relatively quickly and was particularly excited when I crossed the border into Devon. It felt like a bit of a milestone so I took a selfie (you can see it on my twitter). I met Chris just outside a village called Tinhay (we have really enjoyed some of the place names we have been past so far and Tinhay is up there with my favourites). From there it was a 10 mile stretch along a single road and finally onto the winding roads into Oakhampton. 
<br><Br>
The major downside of the day was a strain on the front side of my foot/ankle. Although it didn’t stop me from running, it was uncomfortable and I certainly don’t want it to stick around. I have however been in touch with my fantastic physio Jess (you can find out more about her on the about page) and she has given me some rehab work to do on it. Fingers crossed all will be well for tomorrow.

Onwards and upwards (it is very much still sideways at the moment but the sentiment still stands).
