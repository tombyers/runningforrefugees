When I sit down to write these blogs I often think back over the day and can’t quite believe that what happened in the morning was part of the same day at all. That has been especially the case over the last few days, with what I am calling ‘Tallulah trouble’ taking centre stage. 
<br><br>
James, our knight in shining armour, arrived with the new support car (I have chosen to name him Cool Runnings in honour of Tallulah whose name was also inspired by that film) shortly after 9am and we drove across Bristol to ‘Mr Clutch’ so that we could transfer our belongings from one vehicle to the other. My mum and her partner Tracy had done some fantastic work to swap over insurance and make sure that we were taxed etc etc. And so remarkably we found ourselves in a new car driving to the start line of marathon 9 not long after midday. 
<br><br>
I have been used to starting the marathons between 08:30 and 09:30 in the morning and as a result have settled into a comfortable nutrition routine. It was therefore a bit of a challenge to be starting in the early afternoon and my legs did feel a little heavy as I moved off from the Severn Bridge. I was however conscious of time. If I wanted to catch up the miles (we had stopped a few miles short yesterday) and be done before the light started to fade, I needed to pull out a faster pace than normal. So as I passed through the beautiful Wye Valley, I paid close attention to the ‘minutes per mile’ count on my watch, trying to make sure that it stayed around the 8 minutes per mile mark. Overall I was pretty successful, finishing the almost 30 mile route in under 4 hours and more importantly just before the light faded. 
<br><br>
Tomorrow is another busy day. I am being joined by a few local runners, speaking to BBC Radio Hereford and Worcester and speaking at a local event in Leominster in the evening. But I will endeavour to find time to get the blog done too.

Have a great sleep everyone – I certainly will.
