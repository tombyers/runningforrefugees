Pavements! Glorious, wonderful, brilliant pavements. Today was the first day of the challenge so far that was entirely run on those magical sections of concrete that we (sometimes) find on the side of our roads. As you may be able to tell, this is something that I was rather pleased about. It allowed me to be a little less tense (no lorries driving at me) but it also allowed me to spend the day listening to podcasts and music. Although I am more than happy to run without headphones, I do find that alternating between plugged and unplugged does help to reduce tedium. Those of you who read yesterday’s blog will know that I was starting to ‘watch watch’ a little too much. I do think that the audio distraction today helped me to reduce that.

In an attempt to play yet further mental tricks on myself, I also decided to run a longer first leg. So instead of my normal 10ish miles before the first checkpoint, I ran 14 ½ miles. That meant that the second and third legs were the lesser distances of 8 ½ and 4 ½ miles respectively. Psychologically that really helped as I knew the bulk of the work was already done.

Today turned out to be one of my favourite days so far. Not only were there the pavements, headphones and checkpoint adjustments, there was also the sun and the knowledge that it was my last marathon before a rest day. Realising that the rarity of this combination of factors, I really tried to enjoy it today; it is important to experience the good times as well as the bad.

I do want to mention the lovely people who have hosted us over the last three nights. North of Crewe we stayed with Chris and Judy, the parents of my brother’s friend Caroline (this sort of connection with our hosts is fairly typical). Chris had grown up in Cambridge literally just around the corner from my childhood home and so it was lovely to chat about my hometown. Last night we stayed with Annette who lived in the same Halls of Residence as me when I was at Bangor University. It is fair to say that I didn’t know Annette that well when I was living in North Wales but the few times we had chatted, she had always been lovely. And it seems that impression was spot on! Not only did she get in touch to offer accommodation, she also gave up her bed to Killian and I and slept on the sofas downstairs instead. Finally tonight we are staying with Linda and Steve not far away from Burnley. They also used to live in Cambridge and knew my mum through the charity Emmaus. Like all of our hosts they have treated us to a delicious meal and we have settled down to watch the X-Factor!

Tomorrow is a wonderful rest day! I’ll be back on Monday to embark on marathon 15.
