As I type this blog I am sitting using a Reflexology Foot Massager. Penny and David, our lovely hosts for the evening have very kindly lent it to me and I have to say it is great fun. It subjects your feet to tapping and vibrations which, if nothing else, feel very relaxing. 
<br><br>
Today I went from Tiverton to North Petherton via Wellington and Taunton, a route that saw me leave Devon behind in exchange for Somerset. For the first half of the marathon my legs felt a bit heavy and I was having to work quite hard to get them moving at their normal rate. The discovery of an alternative route alongside a canal (rather than up and over the M5 on an A road) was the boost that I was looking for. To be away from the main roads was such a relief as it takes a good level of concentration to keep an eye on the traffic and make sure that you are on the correct side of the road for the upcoming corners etc. Although the break from the roads wasnâ€™t very long, it did put some wind in my sails and I felt good as I made my way into Somerset.

As I made my way around Wellington the sun made its first fully fledged appearance of the challenge so far. Being a red head the sun cream needs to be applied almost immediately to avoid my skin going the same way as my hair. But there are of course other challenges too. Hot weather leads to extra energy being needed to disperse the heat away from your body and that in turn means less energy for your legs. It was certainly the case that as I climbed away from Taunton my legs started to feel a little empty. Fortunately by that stage I was down to the final 5 miles and so it was much easier psychologically to push through the disconcerting hollow legs feeling.

Tonight Chris and I are staying with Penny and David, the aunty and uncle of my good friend Alice. As with all of our hosts so far, they have been extremely welcoming (hence the foot massager). One post-run challenge that I do face is replenishing the calories expelled during the marathons but fortunately not only is eating a strength of mine but our hosts have been so very generous with sharing their meals with us.

The allure of a rest day in Bristol on Saturday makes me eager for tomorrow to get underway. I look forward to telling you all about it. In the meantime thank you again for reading and hope you have a great evening.
