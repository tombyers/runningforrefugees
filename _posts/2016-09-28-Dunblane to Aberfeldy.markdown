I am back in the driver’s seat after Jo’s guest blog last night. As Jo alluded to, yesterday was a bit of an unusual day. Everything down my right leg decided to hurt at the same time; my bum, my groin, my quads and hamstrings. By the end of yesterday it was my right foot/ankle that was causing me the most trouble. Despite all of those problems the marathon went by very quickly especially in comparison to the final few days of last week. It was a very odd combination. 
<br><br>
The challenge for last night was to do all I could to recover my right foot in time for this morning. That meant extra ice and several pairs of socks to keep a good level of compression on it overnight. I am very pleased to say that it seemed to do the trick. Starting from north of Dunblane this morning, I was a little tentative for the first 4 or 5 miles. I had to concentrate to maintain a running position that reduced the pressure going down through my ankle. But as I got closer to Crieff the foot felt more and more comfortable and I grew in confidence. 
<br><br>
I paused in Crieff to take on some food and drink and then set off in the direction of the hills. I was expecting a hard second stint but the climbs, aside from being consistent, were actually quite gentle. I was also treated to some stunning views; something that I think I will be getting used to over the coming days. 
<br><br>
I was joined for the final five miles by my friend Kevin. Kev and I worked together on the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and it was great to have him there to chat away with. As colleagues we used to do something called ‘Tie Tuesday’. It involved finding a hideous tie in a charity shop and wearing it to work on a Tuesday. In honour of this I purchased some ties in Glasgow and for the last 5 miles we both proudly wore them, getting some strange looks from drivers as we did so. 
<br><br>
Tonight we are staying with Kev’s parents in Perth. As I type we have finished our delicious dinner (curry and crumble if you were interested) and are now watching Celtic Vs Manchester City on TV. They are very kindly putting us up tomorrow night too.

Today was Jo’s final day as support driver and so it would be amiss of me to not say a few words of thanks both to Jo and Courtney (who left on Sunday). Not only have they taken a significant amount of time out to come and support me on the run, they also put in lots of work ahead of the run to make sure that it could happen. In fact it was to Jo that I first mentioned this crazy idea to and she was incredibly supportive from the start. Thank you Jo and Court for all that you have done; without your help this wouldn’t have been possible.
