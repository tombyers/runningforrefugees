Before I start today’s blog, I would like to mention the ‘Auction of Promises for Syrian Children and Families’ that the Rotary Club of Cambridge are organising. The auction is raising money to send equipment directly to Syria (or to nearby camps) and to aid refugees in the Cambridge area. If you live in Cambridge then you can go along to the live auction on Monday night (26th September). If you’re not based in Cambridge you can still join in by bidding on their [website]( http://cambridgerotary.auction-bid.org/micro2.php#lots). There are some fantastic lots on offer from a trip to Centre Parcs or a stay at a Spanish Villa, to a bottle of Scotch Whisky or a pearl necklace. It is a great way to raise money for a great cause so please do join in if you can.

The forecast for today wasn’t great. High winds and plenty of rain was on the cards, a combination that wasn’t massively appealing. As we arrived at the starting line the clouds did look a little bit ominous but it was dry and we were fairly sheltered by trees on either side of the road so the wind didn’t feel overbearing either. And so I set off for marathon number 20. 
<br><br>
The first 16 miles were a continuation of yesterday as I traced the A74(M). For all of my whinging in yesterday’s blog about this patch of road (mostly the B7076), it did have some positive features. It was quiet, wide and had marked cycle lanes at both sides of the road. There were also sections of pavement from time to time which helped to add a bit of contrast! The fact that I am discussing the pros and cons of roads to such a high detail (and choosing to leave this section in the blog) does bring my sanity into question once again. 
<br><br>
I did find the first section of the run a bit tough but it had stayed dry and, rather than being a nuisance, the wind was proving itself to a be an ally. As I neared Crawford the trees became sparse and the wind picked up behind me. At times it was forcibly pushing me along. I even felt at times like I was having to apply the brakes! 
<br><br>
Shortly after Crawford, I finally pulled away from the A74(M) and headed in the direction of small town called Roberton. It was along this section that I was joined by Andy. Andy worked at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and was good friends with my then flatmate Anthony. Although I had met him a few times (normally when I went to Anthony’s desk to discuss 5 a-side football or what dinner we were having to watch in front of Bake Off), Andy wasn’t someone I knew extremely well. And so we come back to the unexpected kindness of relative strangers. Andy had gone out of his way to come and cycle with me for the final 8 or so miles of my run. It was fantastic to have his company and to be able to chat to someone else rather than having endless internal conversations with myself! 
<br><br>
Not only did I have Andy’s company but I was also treated to the South Lanarkshire scenery. From Roberton the road turned into a single track lane and as we reached the top of the hill, the views across the rolling landscape were fantastic. It was a great way to finish marathon 20.
