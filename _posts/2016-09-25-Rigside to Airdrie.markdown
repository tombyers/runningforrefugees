Marathon 21 started in the lovely Lanarkshire countryside just outside a town called Rigside. The first 6 miles took me through quiet country lanes in the direction of Lanark where there was a steep climb up towards the town. From there I followed the A72 to Carluke, a back road to Morningside and then finally joined the A73 to take me into, and then just North of, Airdrie. It is certainly a lot easier typed than ran!

And with that I have made it to the end of week number 3! And what a relief it is. This week has felt like the toughest one so far; I think simply because I am just slowly getting more and more tired. But on the bright side, with the end of marathon 21 comes two significant milestones. Firstly I have now made it north of Glasgow and secondly I have now completed all of my seven day weeks. Next week is a measly 6 marathons and the following week is almost laughable with its mere 4 and a bit marathons (the final day isn’t a full marathon). I realise that sarcasm is a bit of a risk when written down but I hope that you will have all managed to spot it!

I am in Glasgow for the next two nights which I am very excited about. It will be a chance to go back to some of the areas that I used to visit when I lived here, meet up with some old friends and also do some laundry (it is badly needed).

From Tuesday my fourth week of marathons begins. With the final marathon countdown almost around the corner, I would be delighted if you would be able to continue to support me on this challenge and also share it with anyone you think might be interested! We are getting close to our initial £10,000 target, so any help reaching (and perhaps surpassing) that fantastic amount of money would be hugely appreciated.

I did just wanted to post a reminder about the ‘Auction of Promises for Syrian Children and Families’ that the Rotary Club of Cambridge are organising. The auction is raising money to send equipment directly to Syria (or to nearby camps) and to aid refugees in the Cambridge area. If you live in Cambridge then you can go along to the live auction on Monday night (26th September). If you’re not based in Cambridge you can still join in by bidding on their website. There are some fantastic lots on offer from a trip to Centre Parcs or a stay at a Spanish Villa, to a bottle of Scotch Whisky or a pearl necklace. It is a great way to raise money for a great cause so please do join in if you can.
