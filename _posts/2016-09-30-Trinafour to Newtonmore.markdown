Yesterday finished with a descent and so I did half expect today to start with a climb. What I hadn’t prepared for was the severity of the climb! It was one of those where the road zig zags across the face off the hill; the corners doubling back on themselves so that the road can cut along the face of the hill. My brother Will, who was completing his second day as support driver, did a fantastic job of encouraging me up the climb; he even got out of the car several times to run alongside me. Inevitably what was waiting at the top of the climb was yet more fantastic views over towards the Cairngorms National Park. 
<br><br>
The descent took me down to the A9, a road that I will be seeing a lot of between now and John O’Groats. Very helpfully there is a cycle path that runs alongside the A9 meaning that cyclists and pedestrians are kept separate from the main carriageway. We believe that along this section I reached the highest point of the entire challenge at 1516ft above sea level (I will wait for any corrections from the fact checkers amongst you). As bonus fun fact, this point happens to coincide with the highest section of mainline railway in the UK.
<br><br>
I did find today pretty tricky if truth be told. I don’t always feel tired when running but sleepiness did hang around today and I was back to looking at my watch a bit too often. Experience does help though. I know from the past month that the middle of the marathon stints are often the trickiest mentally. Being able to recognise that does help to cope with it. 
<br><br>
I want to finish with another mention to the fantastic people that have been hosting us. After two lovely nights with the Murrays in Perth, tonight we are staying with a woman named Lizzie in the town of Nairn. I have been absolutely bowled over by the kindness of strangers throughout this challenge and to demonstrate this I would like to try to explain how I ‘know’ Lizzie. Bear with me! My mum’s friend Sarah has a family friend called Annabel (whom I stayed with when I was going through Devon). When I was struggling to find somewhere to stay in this area of the country Annabel was incredibly helpful and put the word out amongst some friends she has up here. One of those friends is a woman named Becks who passed the message onto Lizzie. So to conclude Lizzie is a family friend’s, family friend’s, friend’s friend.

And with that head scratcher I am off to bed! Night all.
