The start of this morning’s marathon was a little bit different to the start of the ten marathons that had preceded it. To start with I was setting off from the heart of Ludlow instead of a random gate in the middle of nowhere. But much more excitingly I was joined by a sizeable crowd of people who were there to not only see me off, but also to promote the message of Refugees being welcome in Ludlow. In attendance were two local councillors, two representatives from local churches, four Ludlow Runners and ten or so people from Ludlow Amnesty International. The gathering was mutually beneficial as the Amnesty International Group have been running a ‘Refugees are Welcome Here’ campaign, a message that I was very happy to support. I was very pleased that the four Ludlow runners then joined me for the first 6-7 miles of my run. Having others running with me really does give me a boost and I find the time passes much quicker. Thank you to all of those that came down and clapped me on my way; it was a surreal experience but one that I really appreciated.

Today’s route, which was formed of a network of B roads running from Ludlow to Shrewsbury, was one of my favourites so far. There were several sections of woodland where the tree canopy formed a tunnel for the narrow roads to wind through. A thin layer of mist had formed and the sunlight glinted through the trees. So eerie and magical was the atmosphere that I half expected to glimpse a unicorn drinking from a secluded waterfall. I think the tiredness is getting to me.

As I left the enchanted woods behind, my mind turned to the end of the run where I knew that there were some special guests waiting for me. My mum and her partner Tracy (and daisy the dog) had decided to come across from Cambridge to cheer me over the finish line. It was fantastic to see them and spend time telling them about the adventures that we have had so far.

Tonight we are staying in Telford and our hosts Linda and Steve very kindly took us out to view the Ironbridge. Slightly embarrassingly I had never heard of the Ironbridge even though it is a World Heritage Site. The chance to get out and do some sightseeing brought with it a brief feeling of normality. But then I remembered marathon number 12!
