Reaching the first rest day was always going to be a milestone. After all, seven marathons in as many days is certainly an achievement. And I would love to say that my emotions this evening are of joy and satisfaction but as I want this blog to be a true reflection of my journey to the top of the country, I have to be honest and say that I feel a bit flat! And thinking about it, I should have anticipated that there would be some mixed emotions at this point. 
<br><br>
The first reason for this is being physically and emotionally drained from this last week. Then there is the realisation that there are still twenty five more marathons to come over the course of four more weeks. Thatâ€™s a lot of running and a lot of moving from place to place.
<br><br>
I have said a few times over the last few months that a certain amount of naivety has really helped me in the preparation for the challenge. It has created a bubble that has protected me from worrying about every little thing to do with the run. Perhaps now that bubble has burst and I am exposed to the true challenge; the challenge of balancing the adrenalin-like state that helps with running a marathon with the need to maintain composure and a sense of longevity.  
<br><br>
At these moments it is worth thinking about the cause that I am running for. As much as I feel tired and apprehensive about the next steps of the challenge, I do have many luxuries. I have safe, friendly and largely familiar places to stay. I have safety and support whilst I am running and, if truth be told, I have the option to stop. And it is for these reasons that I will do everything I can to keep running if it means that we can raise lots of money to help those people without those luxuries. 
<br><br>
As this challenge continues over the next few weeks, I will start to talk a little more about the work of the Refugee Council and why I believe it is so important. If I can ask you, as my wonderful readers, to spread the word of the challenge and, if you feel compelled, ask people to donate to the cause, I will be incredibly grateful. 
<br><br>
Have a lovely Saturday and I will be back Sunday morning for marathon number 8.
