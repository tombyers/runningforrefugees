There had been lots of discussions about today’s marathon. A few days ago weather reports were predicting lots of rain and even more wind; neither of which are particularly conducive to running. In fact there had even been discussions about postponing the marathon, rearranging rest days and attempting marathon 24 tomorrow instead. I wasn’t very fond of that idea but did appreciate the efforts that those close to me were making to look out for my safety and ensure that I do indeed make it to the top of the country in just over a week’s time. 
<br><br>
In the end we decided to carry on as planned. All in all I was fairly lucky with the conditions. It was incredibly windy in places but I somehow managed to dodge most of the rain and instead only saw the resulting rainbows (a good omen I think). The other challenge for today were the climbs. My total elevation gain was around 2,300 ft which is one of the tougher climbing days that I have experienced. But where there are climbs there are often great views and that was certainly the case today. My highlights were Aberfeldy, the climb and then descent from Coshieville to Tummel Bridge and then the final section to our finishing point just south of Trinafour.

I have been meaning for the last few days to talk a little bit about the Therapeutic Services that the Refugee Council provide. It is little wonder, given the traumatic events refugees encounter, that many of them have complex psychological issues once they reach the safety of the UK. This includes feelings of “loss, confusion, low moods, anxiety, anger and frustration or even fear and terror” [1]( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/what_we_do/therapeutic_casework/therapeutic_casework_services). In essence the Therapeutic Services provide crisis interventions and counselling in order to help refugees come to terms with their experiences and build responsibility for their own lives. 
<br><br>
As well as the core counselling services there are also several related projects. For example the [Safer Refugee Women Project]( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/what_we_do/therapeutic_casework/powerful_womens_project) aims to provide support to those that have experienced domestic violence. Importantly this work is gender and culturally sensitive. There is also a project that revolves around the use of [Psycho-Social Groups]( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/what_we_do/therapeutic_casework/psycho-social_groups). These groups bring refugees with similar backgrounds together in order to talk about their experiences and as such allow each individual to come to terms with their own stories. 
<br><br>
I would of course encourage you to have a look at the full range of work the sits within the charity’s [Therapeutic Services]( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/what_we_do/therapeutic_casework). The importance of this work is summed up for me by a quote they have included on their website; “I feel a bit stronger, despite some other issues at least I know I can still have a new beginning.”
