I wasn’t looking forward to today’s marathon. We traced the route last night and quickly found that I was to be on the A49 the whole way. The big A-roads, as I think I have mentioned before, are not always very pleasant to run down and do require lots of concentration. Yesterday we had managed to divert through backroads but there didn’t seem to be any obvious ways of doing that for today’s run. Fortunately what I found was that ¾ of today’s section of A49 did in fact have pavements so I wasn’t right alongside the traffic. 
<br><br>
Over the last few days I have become more restless when I am running. I look at my watch a little too frequently, hoping that another mile has ticked by. This is perhaps not surprising, after all today was marathon number 13 and my head is just as tired (if not more so) as my body. I hope that the rest day can help me to re-establish a mind-set that is conscious of the longer term but happy to be routed in the present. It is a really tricky balance to strike and something that I have only managed to do in parts. The remaining 19 marathons will be very tough if I continue to fight against the running.

In [yesterday’s blog]( http://www.runningforrefugees.co.uk/2016/09/15/Shrewsbury-to-Whitchurch.html), I started to outline my reasons for supporting the Refugee Council. Well today I did want to delve a bit more into an incredibly important part of their work – The Children’s Section. 
<br><br>
In 2015 3,043 separated children claimed asylum in the UK (1). The Refugee Council work with around 1,000 of these separated children each year (2). Work includes an advice service for those negotiating the asylum system, providing safety to those that have been trafficked and helping young refugees prove that they are children (age is something that is often disputed by the Home Office or by Local Authorities). A part of their work that I am particularly passionate about is there [Youth Activities and Educational Services]( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/what_we_do/childrens_services/youth_activities_and_educational_services/educational_services). They give children who have had their childhood taken away from them a chance to learn and play with others their own age. 
<br><br>
I would highly recommend looking at the child refugee stories that the Refugee Council have published on their [website]( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/animation). They do a better job than I ever could of contextualising the lives of these young people.

Thanks for reading everyone. One more marathon to go until rest day number two.
