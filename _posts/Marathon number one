It’s been a couple of weeks since my last blog post and boy has a lot happened. To avoid getting side-tracked by politics, let’s start with the main running news: I have completed a marathon! That’s right, I have now officially completed the 26.3 mile distance. It is another huge milestone for me and has further bolstered my confidence that I can actually do this thing.

I completed the marathon last Sunday morning, running from my flat in Ealing to various central London landmarks and back again. Perhaps most pleasingly my body wasn’t too angry with me afterwards. Sure there were a few aches but structurally things seem to be mostly OK!

The next phase of training focuses on doing these long distances with increasing frequency. Training has so far been structured around 6 runs in a week; 3 short distance, 2 medium distance and 1 long distance. Now I will start to move towards slightly shorter long distance runs but completing them on all 6 days. For example next week I will be running 17.5 miles each day.

Not only is this a different physical challenge but it is an entirely different mental challenge. I have become used to psyching myself up for the longest run of the week and being comforted by the knowledge of a short run the next day. I will need to change how I think about each run and put in place methods to avoid tedium.

Before signing off, I would like to draw your attention to a quiz night taking in place in Vauxhall London on 3rd August. It will be a chance to raise some more money for the refugee council and to generally have a good time! Full details can be found on the Facebook page. Everyone is welcome – three words that will take me back to my political ponderings!
