There is a cliché in football commentary that talks about ‘a game of two halves’. My first marathon fits that saying perfectly. Let’s focus on the first half first! 
<br><br>
We arrived in Land’s End shortly after 10:00 but by the time I had nervously fiddled around making sure I had everything and we had taken several photos, it was almost 10:30 by the time I was standing on the ‘start line’. The way that the visitor centre is organised means that the tourist coaches park on the start/finish line for the ‘end to end’ challenges. So my first steps away from Land’s End involved dodging tourists; it was like being momentarily back in central London. 
<br><br>
After I had completed the tourist slalom, I was soon out onto the open roads and I happily ticked off the miles on the stretch of the A30 that winds its way to Penzance. I was in fact a little too comfortable and probably went a little too quickly. I was waiting for the support car as they arrived at the first check point. A quick drink and a bite to eat and I was off again. 
<br><Br>
Then the rain came and so the second half began. The rain was light at first and I was still care free as I emerged the other side of Penzance. But as the rain got heavier so did my legs; I was paying the price for going off too quickly. The route turned inland and became increasingly hilly. Streams formed at the side of the road and my t-shirt gradually turned into a dress as it soaked up all of the water. My phone, which was acting as my map, decided it had had enough just before mile 19 and got stuck on vibrate. Fortunately the rest of the route wasn’t overly complicated and my Uncle and Brother did a brilliant job of signposting the turns that I had to make in order to find my way to Tuckinghill. The final challenge was a long ascent up to the finish line, which temptingly lay outside a McDonald’s. I stuck to my protein shake!

For all that I have gone on about the rain, it was still fantastic to get started. There were several points (admittedly in the first half) that I couldn’t help but grin; I am finally underway.

I would like to say a big thank you to everyone that has liked, commented and shared posts today. It made such a difference and really kept me going over the last few miles. Now on to marathon number two!
