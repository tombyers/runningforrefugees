What a difference a day (and a great physio) makes! I finished yesterday frustrated and concerned at the emergence of a strain to the front of the foot/ankle. Sure I have had other niggles so far, but this one was new and causing me more discomfort than the others. I certainly didn’t want it to stick around. But after some recovery work overnight I am very happy to say that today’s run was almost entirely pain free! 
<br><br>
It is at this stage that I want to mention my physio Jess from Injury Active Clinic (she was also a classmate of mine when I was at Hills Road Sixth Form college). During the build up to this challenge she has always managed to calm me down when I was worried about a strain that I had picked up. What’s more she has always managed to give me great advice on how to get back up and running (pardon the pun). She did exactly the same this time round, giving me remote advice about what to do. 
<br><br>
Of course when I started today’s marathon I was unsure how well the recovery work had gone but as I ticked off the miles I became more confident with my body again. At the first checkpoint we decided that I would try to make up the miles that we had lost to diversions on day three. It would mean running an extra 4-5 miles but I felt in the right shape to do it. So I plodded on, reaching the marathon mark near a town called Bickleigh and then continuing through until the far side of Tiverton. In the end it was almost 31 miles but it felt great to be caught up.

The successes of the day didn’t stop there. Some of you may know that I have been studying a part time Open University degree for the last 3 years; well last night I submitted my final assignment. I am very relieved that it is now complete and am very pleased that it won’t constantly be in the back of my mind for the rest of the run. Thank you for indulging me with that off topic side note!

Before wrapping up this blog, I do want to mention the lovely people that we have stayed with over the last three nights. First of all to Alison and Angus (and Scout the dog) in the beautiful village of Bere Ferres. They laid on a delicious three course meal for us which included me consuming a mountain of pasta and finishing it off with some Salcombe ice cream. And then for the last two nights we have been staying with Annabel and Jim and their son Patrick. Staying on their farm above Tiverton, we have really been made to feel at home. From wonderful food with the family to feeding the cats (named un, deux, trois, cat) and collecting the pony from the field, it has been a little snippet into country life! I should really make a special mention to Patrick who, at the age of seven, has enough energy to run two marathons every day. One of my highlights was watching him play football against Chris. I think it is fair to say that Chris was a little worn out by the end!
