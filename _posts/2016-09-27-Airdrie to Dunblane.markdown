Hi everyone, my names Jo Torpy and I’m one of Matt’s support crew members. After pestering Matt for over a week he has finally agreed to allow me to write a guest blog! So I thought I’d shed some light on the tasks undertaken by the support team throughout each marathon and give you an external perspective on how marathon number twenty two went.
<br><br>
We started the day in Airdire, Matt spent about ten minutes or so snacking on bananas, stretching and pumping himself up for the marathon ahead while I posted a pre-run photo onto the Facebook page. After Matt set off, I jumped in the support car and made my way to the first of two meeting points – about 11 miles from the starting point.
<br><br>
When Matt approached the first meeting point he had a pained look on his face and complained about a sore right leg, in particular his ankle. He used the foam roller to try and ease some of the tension in his legs and then set off on the next section of the marathon.
<br><br>
I was a concerned about the amount of discomfort he was in so decided to stop five miles down the road, just in case he needed to stretch out again but he jogged passed me with a thumbs up which gave me a sense of relief and I moved on to the official second meeting point.
<br><br>
Once Matt arrived at the second meeting point he seemed quite dazed and bemused. At one point he stated it was like he was floating and that it didn’t feel like he had run the second leg! I made sure he had plenty to eat and drink and he was off.
<br><br>
Today’s marathon finished in Dunblane, after twenty two marathons with only three days off Matt’s poor feet were letting him know that they have felt every step of every marathon he has run so far. After another quick photoshoot he hobbled into the car. Staying in another wonderful accommodation home with Diane and Alan in Stirling meant Matt was able to ice his ankles and do a more extensive recovery, which he hopes will get his body ready for another big day tomorrow.
