Marathon nineteen turned out to be a bit of a struggle. Throughout the challenge, I have often been very tired in the evenings but have been able to recover and feel fairly fresh the next day. This morning was a different story. As I set off from just outside a small village called Kirkpatrick-Fleming, I felt sluggish. It wasn’t my legs, they continued to do a sterling job, it was my head that was on the ropes. The route didn’t really help either; I was following the B7076 all day, a road that winds alongside the A74(M). Without moving from road to road there were less small targets to aim at and I did become restless a little too quickly. My legs took over though and guided me through until the first checkpoint in Lockerbie.
<br><br>
My friend (and current support team member) Courtney had said that she was going to run the last 5 miles with me and so my focus after leaving Lockerbie was getting through until the final checkpoint after which Courtney would join in. Slowly but surely I ticked off the miles. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately as I reached the checkpoint things didn’t go quite as smoothly as I would have hoped. As I turned into the side road that the support car was parked in, I saw Jo and Courtney patting down their pockets and looking slightly flustered. I quickly put two and two together and realised that the keys were locked inside the car. I have to admit that I wasn’t best pleased! The innocent mishap came at a bad moment when things were feeling tough. Fortunately it didn’t take too long to get an RAC mechanic to fish the keys out of their resting place inside the car. 
<br><br>
With some extra food consumed I was ready to go and excitingly I had Courtney by my side. Having someone to run with and chat to from time to time is a brilliant distraction and really does help to give me a boost of energy.

Before I sign off for the night, I would like to mention our most recent hosts. On Wednesday night we stayed in a beautiful converted barn run by Ian and Ruth Tupling. Nestled in the village of Great Strickland, they normally let the self-catered outhouse but they kindly offered it to us for free. Last night we stayed with Gillian and Chris Lake in Annan. We had a great time discussing trips to New Zealand and when their son John arrived we were fascinated to hear about his experience in the merchant navy. They were incredibly generous with the meals they cooked for us too.

Tomorrow sees me complete marathon 20 which is a little surreal. As always thank you all for your support.
