When I first started to properly think about this challenge back in the middle of 2015, I quickly realised that I was going to need a fair bit of help. Where I could stay, who would travel with me, how would these people travel, where would we stay, who could I ask to help with editing videos etc. etc. I needn’t have worried. People have been so incredibly generous and very willing to give their time, expertise or indeed money to the challenge.

It all started with a core group of close friends and family who very kindly agreed to lead certain areas of the challenge. You can find out more about them by visiting the [about page](http://www.runningforrefugees.co.uk/about/) (please do, they really are awesome people). With their help I was able to flesh out what the challenge would look like and how it might work.

Then it came to starting to talk about the challenge more openly. This was the point of no return and I to be completely honest I was pretty nervous about it! However, not only was the news of the challenge greeted with lots of enthusiasm, the response to my plea for help with accommodation was truly heart-warming. People who I hadn’t seen in a long time took the time to message and offer their support. 

I have even been lucky enough to get some sponsors. Having the backing of Mizuno for my shoes and The Active Injury Clinic for my physio is a massive boost for me. A friend has offered to help with Strength & Conditioning and a family friend has said he will sort out a car for the support team to travel in. There is even more exciting news on the horizon with another sponsor all but confirmed. 

Thank you to all of these people and to everyone who donates. Your support helps motivate me to get out of the door and keep running but much more importantly it will help us to raise lots of money and awareness for the Refugee Council.
